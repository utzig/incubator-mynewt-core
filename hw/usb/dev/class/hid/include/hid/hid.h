 * @brief The device HID GET/SET report structure.
 *
 * This structure is used to pass data when the event type is kUSB_DeviceHidEventGetReport,
 * kUSB_DeviceHidEventSetReport, and kUSB_DeviceHidEventRequestReportBuffer.
 * 1. kUSB_DeviceHidEventGetReport
 *    The structure is used to save the report buffer and report length got from the application.
 *    The reportBuffer is the report data buffer address filled by the application.
 *    The reportLength is the report length.
 *    The reportType is the requested report type.
 *    The reportId is the requested report ID.
 *
 * 2. kUSB_DeviceHidEventSetReport
 *    The structure is used to pass the report data received from the host to the application.
 *    The reportBuffer is buffer address of the report data received from the host.
 *    The reportLength is the report data length.
 *    The reportType is the requested report type.
 *    The reportId is the requested report ID.
 *
 * 3. kUSB_DeviceHidEventRequestReportBuffer
 *    The structure is used to get the buffer to save the report data sent by the host.
 *    The reportBuffer is buffer address to receive to report data. It is filled by the application.
 *    The reportLength is the requested report data buffer length.
 *    The reportType is the requested report type.
 *    The reportId is the requested report ID.
