## Blinky, your "Hello World!", on Arduino Zero

Learn how to use packages from a default application repository of Mynewt to build your first *Hello World* application (Blinky) on a target board. Once built using the *newt* tool, this application will blink the LED lights on the target board.

This tutorial describes how to run Mynewt OS on Arduino Zero. Follow these simple steps and your board will be blinking in no time!

### Prerequisites

Before tackling this tutorial, it's best to read about Mynewt in the [Introduction](../get_started/introduction) section of this documentation.

### Equipment

You will need the following equipment

* An Arduino Zero board.  NOTE: There are many flavors of Arduino. Ensure that 
you have an Arduino Zero. See below for the versions of Arduino Zero that are
compatible with this tutorial
* A computer that can connect to the Arduino Zero over USB
* A USB cable (Type A to micro B) that can connect the computer to the Arduino
* The Mynewt Release

This tutorial has been tested on the following three Arduino Zero boards - Zero, M0 Pro, and Zero-Pro.

Mynewt has not been tested on Arduino M0 which has no internal debugger support.

### Install Mynewt and Newt

* If you have not already done so, install Newt as shown in the [Newt install tutorial](../../newt/install/newt_mac.md)
* If you have not already done so, create a project as shown in the Quick Start guide on how to [Create Your First Project](../get_started/project_create.md). Skip the testing and building the project steps in that tutorial since you will be defining a target for your Arduino board in this tutorial.

### Fetch External Packages 

Mynewt uses source code provided directly from the chip manufacturer for 
low level operations. Sometimes this code is licensed only for the specific manufacturer of the chipset and cannot live in the Apache Mynewt repository. That happens to be the case for the Arduino Zero board which uses Atmel SAMD21. Runtime's github repository hosts such external third-party packages and the Newt tool can fetch them.

To fetch the package with MCU support for Atmel SAMD21 for Arduino Zero from the Runtime git repository, you need to add 
the repository to the `project.yml` file in your base project directory.

Here is an example ```project.yml``` file with the Arduino Zero repository
added. The sections with ```mynewt_arduino_zero``` that need to be added to 
your project file are highlighted.

```hl_lines="6 14 15 16 17 18"
$ more project.yml 
project.name: "my_project"

project.repositories:
    - apache-mynewt-core
    - mynewt_arduino_zero

repository.apache-mynewt-core:
    type: github
    vers: 0-latest
    user: apache
    repo: incubator-mynewt-core

repository.mynewt_arduino_zero:
    type: github
    vers: 0-latest
    user: runtimeinc
    repo: mynewt_arduino_zero
$ 
```

<br>

Once you've edited your ```project.yml``` file, the next step is to install the 
project dependencies, this can be done with the ```newt install``` command 
(to see more output, provide the ```-v``` verbose option.): 

```no-highlight
$ newt install 
apache-mynewt-core
mynewt_arduino_zero
$
```

<br>

**NOTE:** If there has been a new release of a repo used in your project since you last installed it, the `0-latest` version for the repo in the `project.yml` file will refer to the new release and will not match the installed files. In that case you will get an error message saying so and you will need to run `newt upgrade` to overwrite the existing files with the latest codebase.

<br>

### Create your bootloader target

Next, you need to tell Newt what to build.  For the Arduino Zero, we are going to 
generate both a bootloader, and an image target.

To generate the bootloader target, you need to specify the following options. The output of the commands (indicating success) have been suppressed for easier readability. 

```no-highlight
$ newt target create arduino_boot 
$ newt target set arduino_boot bsp=@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero 
$ newt target set arduino_boot app=@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot 
$ newt target set arduino_boot build_profile=optimized
```

<br>

If you have an Arduino Zero Pro or M0 Pro, you have to set the following next:

```
$ newt target set arduino_boot features=arduino_zero_pro 
```

If you have an Arduino Zero, you have to set the following instead:

```
$ newt target set arduino_boot features=arduino_zero 
```

<br>

These commands do a few things: 

  * Create a target named ```arduino_boot```, in order to build the Arduino Zero Bootloader.
  * Set the application for the ```arduino_boot``` target to the default Apache Mynewt 
    bootloader (```@apache-mynewt-core/apps/boot```)
  * Set the board support package for the target to 
    ```@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero```.  This is a reference to the downloaded 
    Arduino Zero support from Github.
  * Use the "optimized" build profile for the `arduino_boot` target.  This
    instructs Newt to generate smaller and more efficient code for this target.
    This setting is necessary due to the bootloader's strict size constraints.
  * Tells the Board Support Package to enable support for the Arduino Zero Pro or the Arduino Zero. Set it to `arduino_zero` or `arduino_zero_pro` depending on the board you have.

<br>

### Build your bootloader

Once you've configured the bootloader target, the next step is to build the bootloader for your Arduino. You can do this by using the ```newt build``` command:

```no-highlight
$ newt build arduino_boot 
Compiling asprintf.c
Compiling atoi.c
Compiling atol.c
Compiling atoll.c
Compiling bsearch.c
Compiling bzero.c
Compiling calloc.c
Compiling fgets.c
Compiling inline.c
<snip>
App successfully built: myproject/bin/arduino_boot/apps/boot/boot.elf
```

If this command finishes successfully, you have successfully built the Arduino 
bootloader, and the next step is to build your application for the Arduino 
board.

<br>

### Build your blinky app 

To create and download your application, you create another target, this one pointing to the application you want to download to the Arduino board.  In this tutorial,  we will use the default application that comes with your project, ```apps/blinky```:

**Note**: Remember to set features to `arduino_zero` if your board is Arduino Zero and not a Pro!

```hl_lines="9"
$ newt target create arduino_blinky 
Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully created
$ newt target set arduino_blinky app=apps/blinky 
Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.app to apps/blinky
$ newt target set arduino_blinky bsp=@mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero
Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.bsp to @mynewt_arduino_zero/hw/bsp/arduino_zero
$ newt target set arduino_blinky build_profile=debug 
Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully set target.build_profile to debug
$ newt target set arduino_blinky features=arduino_zero_pro 
Target targets/arduino_blinky successfully set pkg.features to arduino_zero_pro
$ 
```

<br>

You can now build the target, with ```newt build```: 

```no-highlight
$ newt build arduino_blinky 
Compiling main.c
Archiving blinky.a
Compiling cons_fmt.c
Compiling cons_tty.c
Archiving full.a
Compiling case.c
Compiling suite.c
Compiling testutil.c
Archiving testutil.a
<snip>
App successfully built: myproject/bin/arduino_blinky/apps/blinky/blinky.elf
```
<font color="#FF0000"> Congratulations! </font> You have successfully built your application. Now it's time to load both the bootloader and application onto the target.

<br>

### Connect the Target

Connect your computer to the Arduino Zero (from now on we'll call this the 
target) with the Micro-USB cable through the Programming Port as shown below. 
Mynewt will download and debug the target through this port. You should see a 
little green LED come on. That means the board has power.

No external debugger is required.  The Arduino Zero comes with an internal
debugger that can be accessed by Mynewt.

A image below shows the Arduino Zero Programming Port.

<img src="http://www.arduino.org//images/products/ArduinoZeroPro-flat-org.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 330px;"/>

<br>

### Download the Bootloader

Execute the command to download the bootloader. 

```c
    $ newt load arduino_boot
```

If the newt tool finishes without error, that means the bootloader has been 
successfully loaded onto the target.

<br>

<font color="#FF0000"> Reminder if you are using Docker: </font> When working with actual hardware, remember that each board has an ID. If you swap boards and do not refresh the USB Device Filter on the VirtualBox UI, the ID might be stale and the Docker instance may not be able to see the board correctly. For example, you may see an error message like `Error: unable to find CMSIS-DAP device` when you try to load or run an image on the board. In that case, you need to click on the USB link in VirtualBox UI, remove the existing USB Device Filter (e.g. "Atmel Corp. EDBG CMSIS-DAP[0101]") by clicking on the "Removes selected USB filter" button, and add a new filter by clicking on the "Adds new USB filter" button.

<br>

### Run the Image 

Now that the bootloader is downloaded to the target, the next step is to load 
your image onto the Arduino Zero.  The easiest way to do this, is to use the 
```newt run``` command.  ```newt run``` will automatically rebuild your program
(if necessary), create an image, and load it onto the target device.

Here, we will load our ```arduino_blinky``` target onto the device, and we 
should see it run:

<br>

**NOTE:** The 0.0.0 specified after the target name to `newt run` is the version 
of the image to load.  If you are not providing remote upgrade, and are just 
developing locally, you can provide 0.0.0 for every image version.

If you want the image to run without the debugger connected, simply quit the 
debugger and restart the board.  The image you programmed will come and run on the Arduino on next boot!

### Watch the LED blink

Congratulations! You have created a Mynewt operating system running on the 
Arduino Zero. The LED right next to the power LED should be blinking. It is toggled by one task running on the Mynewt OS.   

We have more fun tutorials for you to get your hands dirty. Be bold and try other Blinky-like [tutorials](../tutorials/nRF52.md) or try enabling additional functionality such as [remote comms](project-target-slinky.md) on the current board.

If you see anything missing or want to send us feedback, please do so by signing up for appropriate mailing lists on our [Community Page](../../community.md).

Keep on hacking and blinking!
